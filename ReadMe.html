<P><A name=Anchor-Installation-21683></A><B><FONT size=+2>Installation
Instructions<BR></FONT></B><BR><B><FONT size=+1>Installing and Uninstalling
Acrobat Reader for Windows</FONT></B><BR><BR>To install Acrobat Reader, follow
these steps:<BR><BR>- Make sure you have at least 90 MB of available disk
space<BR>- Make sure you have turned off all anti-virus software before
beginning the installation.<BR>- Install Reader.<BR><BR>On some versions of
Windows (Windows NT, Windows 2000, Windows XP) you need to have admin rights to
install Acrobat Reader. [ 526383 ]<BR><BR>To uninstall Acrobat Reader, follow
these steps:<BR>- From Start select Settings, Control Panel, Add/Remove
Programs<BR>- Select&nbsp;Adobe Acrobat 5.0 and press the Add/Remove...
button<BR></P>
<P>Note: Uninstalling Acrobat Reader 5.1 also uninstalls versions 4.0 and higher
of Acrobat from your system.You may later need to reinstall Acrobat. Please
ensure that you have access to your original Acrobat CD and serial number before
uninstalling Acrobat Reader 5.1.<BR></P>
<P><B>Acrobat Reader 5.1 file and folder names</B><BR></P>
<P>Acrobat Reader 5.1 is part of the Acrobat 5.0 family. The application is
installed into the Acrobat 5.0 tree. To check the version of Acrobat Reader you
are running, choose About Acrobat Reader under the Help menu.<BR></P>
<P><B>Installation Issues</B><BR><BR>Make sure you have turned off all
anti-virus software before beginning the installation. Device drivers may also
conflict with Acrobat Reader's installer. Starting Windows 98 in Safe Mode, or
starting Windows NT in VGA mode, causes Windows to load only essential standard
device drivers.<BR><BR>If the Acrobat Reader installer or uninstaller fails to
work properly, manually delete the file Uninst.isu from Program Files\Common
Files\Adobe\Acrobat 5.0\98 or NT then reinstall Acrobat Reader and
uninstall.<BR><BR><B>Installing Asian Language Files for Acrobat Reader
5.x<BR></B><BR>Asian Language Files are available for Acrobat Reader 5.x. With
any language version of Acrobat Reader 5.x, you can display Adobe Portable
Document Format (PDF) files that contain text in Chinese Simplified, Chinese
Traditional, Japanese, and Korean (CJK). All you need to do is install the
appropriate Asian font pack for use with Acrobat Reader. The Asian Language
Support installers are available from Adobe's web site at:<BR><A

name=Anchor-Troubleshooting-46919></A><B><FONT size=+2>Troubleshooting
Issues<BR><BR></FONT></B><B>Using the Toolbar<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B></P>
<P>Adobe Acrobat Reader 5.1 provides some of the same functionality as Adobe
Acrobat including send mail, saving documents, comments, digital signatures, and
advanced forms. These features, however, are only available when viewing special
"rights-enabled"&nbsp;PDF documents. For PDF&nbsp;documents that do not contain
these special rights, some tools will appear "grayed-out" and are inactive. This
is normal. For additional information, see Help &gt; Reader Help.</P>
<P>Acrobat Reader's toolbars can be torn-off, docked on the top, and their
geometry may be changed. Torn-off toolbars cannot be combined by dragging the
title bar of the toolbar; use the drag handle of the toolbar instead. [ 398112
]<BR><BR><B>Viewing PDF files within Internet Explorer and Netscape</B><BR>When
attempting to view relatively large PDF files, you may see an error message
saying "Page processing error. File input/output error. Time out during
connecting." Other symptoms that you may see are Acrobat Reader displays blank
pages or Acrobat Reader may hang. Check with your systems or network
administrator that the version of Apache being used is 1.3.17 or greater.
Acrobat Reader may exhibit the symptoms listed above with earlier versions of
Apache. [ 417553 ]<BR><BR><B>Accessibility</B><BR>An expanded version of Acrobat
Reader for Windows includes support for the visually impaired. To determine if
your copy of Acrobat Reader has accessibility functions, check for the presence
of the MSAA plug-in in the Help &gt; About Adobe Acrobat Plug-ins
dialog.<BR><BR><B>Accessibility - </B><B>Using Reflow with a screen
reader</B><BR>For reliable results with a screen reader, only reflow documents
that are not being delivered to the screen reader one page at a time. You can
control how documents are delivered to the screen reader by setting the Content
Delivery preference in the Accessibility preference panel. [ 418683
]<BR><BR><B>America Online - Using File &gt; Open in America Online 6.0 will
open a PDF file in a text editor.</B><BR>When you go through the steps you are
informed by a dialog box that the PDF file is not a recognized file type and
will be opened in a text editor. To view a PDF file that is on your hard drive
or LAN, just select it in Windows Explorer and Acrobat Reader will be launched
and will load the file. [ 405406, 406627 ]<BR><BR><B>Chinese, Korean, and
Japanese (CJK) Acrobat Substitution Fonts<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>Attempting
to activate by Adobe® Type Manager® and use the Acrobat CJK substitution fonts
that are installed by Acrobat (for example, KozMinPro-Regular-Acro.otf) is not
recommended and results may be unpredictable. [ 390851 ]<BR><BR><B>CJK Text
Display in Acrobat Reader Dialogs<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>On a Roman system,
Chinese, Korean, and Japanese (CJK) text cannot be displayed in Acrobat Reader
dialogs. Acrobat Reader requires a CJK system with the appropriate CJK system
font in order to display CJK characters in its dialogs. [ 395326 ]<BR><BR><B>CJK
Text Display when Overprint Preview is on<BR></B>When a PDF containing CJK
characters that have a relatively complicated glyph design, is viewed with
Overprint Preview turned on, the text may look less clear than when Overprint
Preview is turned off. [ 416395 ]<BR><BR><B>CJK Text Display of bolded text when
magnification is applied</B><BR>Some CJK bolded characters may be blurred if the
original application created the bolded text with synthetic bolding. If the
Smooth Text and Use CoolType preferences in the Display preference panel are
turned off, when the document is magnified you may see some white areas or
cracks. Acrobat 4.x writes a character four times to achieve bolding, and for
some documents, such text may appear as four lines of text instead of appearing
as bold text. In Acrobat 5.x, synthetic bolding is used. Adobe recommends
turning on the Smooth Text and Use CoolType preferences in the Display
preference panel to avoid seeing white areas or cracks when the bolded text is
magnified. [ 418447 ]<BR><BR><B>CJK Forms<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>On a
system which does not have Asian Language Support installed, if you open a CJK
Forms PDF which contains differently encoded CJK characters than those the Form
was created with, the CJK Form fields will not be displayed correctly. Most Form
fields will not appear at all. To prevent this, be sure to install Asian
Language Support on systems that will be viewing and using CJK Forms. See this
ReadMe's section titled "Installing Asian Language Files for Acrobat Reader 5.x"
above for additional information. [ 412829 ]<B><FONT
size=+1><BR></FONT></B><BR><B>Find Dialog - </B><B>Using Find to Locate</B><B>
</B><B>Unicode Characters</B><BR>You can use Find to locate Unicode characters
within a PDF document. To do this, add a "\u" in front of the Unicode character
for which you want to search. For example, to search for the Unicode equivalent
of the ASCII character "A" , enter "\u0041" in the Find dialog. For some CJK
characters, such as Unicode "4e01", you can specify "\u4e01". [ 413632
]<BR><BR><B>Acrobat Reader 5.x support for the Hong Kong Supplemental Character
Set</B><BR>The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government recently
introduced the Hong Kong Supplemental Character Set (HKSCS). Acrobat Reader
allows you to view and print PDF files containing HKSCS characters on all
supported Windows operating systems supported by Acrobat Reader (see the System
Requirements section). If you would like to view or print PDF files that contain
text using the Hong Kong character set, please install support for the Chinese
Traditional character set using Custom Install, or installing the Chinese
Traditional Language Pack. [ 418559 ]<BR><BR><B>Hong Kong Character Set and
Comments and Bookmarks<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>Acrobat Reader 5.x supports
the Hong Kong character set for text in a PDF file. It is an extension to the
Adobe Chinese Traditional character set. If you would like to view PDF files
that contain text using the Hong Kong character set, please install support for
the Chinese Traditional character set using Custom Install, or installing the
Chinese Traditional Language Pack. Since the Hong Kong character set is not part
of the standard system fonts you will not be able to comment or create bookmarks
using Hong Kong characters. [ 407877 ]<BR><BR><B>Installing Acrobat 3.x or 4.x
After Installing Acrobat Reader 5.x<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>If you install
Acrobat 3.x or 4.x after installing Acrobat Reader 5.x, Acrobat Reader will be
unexpectedly launched every time a folder is opened in Windows Explorer. To
avoid this problem, always uninstall Acrobat Reader 5.x before installing an
older version of Acrobat. [ 400589 ]<BR><BR><B>Movie Plug-in - viewing a movie
in a floating window<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>When viewing a movie that plays
in a floating window, you can stop the movie at any time by pressing the Escape
key. [ 410153 ]<BR><BR><B>Movie Plug-in - Remote URL requires QuickTime 4 or
later</B><BR>If you will be using the Movie tool to view Movies by pressing a
link to a remote link, be sure to have QuickTime 4 or later installed on your
system. [ 418201 ]<BR><BR><B>Netscape 6.0<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>Acrobat
Reader 5.x supports Netscape 4.x and Netscape 6.1 browsers and installs a
plug-in to work with these browsers. This plug-in enables users to download,
view, navigate and print Adobe PDF files, and to fill in PDF forms while working
inside the browser. With Netscape 6.0, PDF files must be downloaded in their
entirety before they can be viewed. Also, with Netscape 6.0, PDF forms cannot be
filled in when viewed within the Browser. Please use Netscape 6.1 if you have
that option.<BR><BR><B>Nvidia TNT graphics card with True (32-bit) color
set</B><BR>If you are using a Nvidia TNT graphics card and your display is set
to use True (32-bit) color, you may experience a general protection fault crash
in Module NVDISP.drv. The crash will occur if the Opacity setting in the
Comments preferences is set to less than 100% and there are one or more Comment
popup windows overlapping. You can avoid the problem by setting the Opacity in
the Comments Preferences to 100% or by setting the display to 16-bit color (in
the Display Control Panel). Please check the Nvidia web site for a driver update
that may solve this problem. [ 419590 ]<BR><BR><B>Printing ImageType 4 files to
Lexmark printers</B><BR>Image Type 4 is a feature of PostScript 3. While
application software creates ImageType 4 files somewhat infrequently, a PDF
created from a GIF file with transparency using Acrobat WebCapture will contain
ImageType 4.<BR>When files containing ImageType 4 are printed to the Lexmark
printers listed below, the printer may hang and no output is produced. The
Lexmark printer models are: <BR>-Lexmark Optra C710 PS3, PS Version 3010.010, PS
revision 2000411<BR>-Lexmark Optra W810PS3, PS Version 3010.010, PS revision
990917<BR><BR>To work around this problem, you have two options: <BR>1. Choose
Print As Image from the Print dialog. This will produce results similar to what
you see on the screen.<BR>2. If your platform is Windows, you can change the
Print Method from Language Level 3 to Language Level 2. However, on the
Macintosh, there is no Print Method field. To get the same effect, you could
edit the PPD file to make it reflect language level 2, for example,
change:<BR>*PSVersion: "(3010.010)"<BR>to:<BR>*PSVersion: "(2014.700)"<BR>Do not
change your PPD file if Print As Image produces the desired results. Forcing the
file to print at language level 2 enables Image Type 4 to print, but all
transparency will be lost. [ 416539 ]<BR><BR><B>Printing smooth shades to the
HP4050N</B><BR>Smooth shades may be clipped when you print to the HP4050N
printer using HP's PCL 6 printer driver. You may want to try printing such files
with HP's PCL 5e driver. [ 418321 ]<BR><BR><B>Reflow<FONT
size=+1><BR></FONT></B>Documents cannot be reflowed at certain magnification and
window width combinations. Acrobat Reader magnifies the document to whatever
magnification level it can display without failing. [ 401685 ]<BR><BR><B>Save A
Copy<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>Acrobat Reader 5.1 contains a menu item and a
toolbar icon called "Save A Copy". If you fill in a form within an Adobe PDF
file in Acrobat Reader 5.1, your changes will not be preserved when you use this
command unless the PDF file includes the Document Right "Save Document". Please
see "Document Rights" in Help&gt; Reader&nbsp;Help for more
information.<BR><BR>If the PDF does not include the
"Save&nbsp;Document"&nbsp;Document Right, only a copy of the original Adobe PDF
file will be saved. [ 414048 ]<BR><BR><B>Searching is not supported for certain
characters</B><BR>Adobe Acrobat Catalog does not support the indexing of WinAnsi
characters 0127 through 0158. This set of characters includes symbols such as
currency symbols (for example, dollar sign, Euro, Yen). Adobe Acrobat Catalog
also does not support the indexing of documents formattedwith ligatures enabled,
lower case numerals, or with small caps. Since these characters can not be
indexed, you cannot use Search to find occurences of them in a PDF file. [
443269,418016 ]<BR><BR><B>WebBuy on Windows 2000<FONT size=+1><BR></FONT></B>On
Windows 2000, Service Pack 1 is required for WebBuy to show a Zip drive as a
device in:<BR>Edit-&gt;Preferences&gt;General&gt;WebBuy&gt;Select Other
Identifiers. [ 390998 ]<BR><BR><B>WebBuy on Windows 2000 on a system with
multiple processors<BR></B>If you buy an electronic book using WebBuy from one
processor and later attempt to access the book from another processor you will
be denied access. This may happen, for example, if you purchase the electronic
book from one log-in and later attempt to access it from another log-in. To
prevent this, use the same log-in to access the book as that used to purchase
the book. [ 413006 ]<BR><BR><B>WebBuy requires the latest Iomega
drivers</B><BR>Be sure to install the latest Iomega drivers for all Jaz®, Clik!®
or Zip® drives if you want to use the media for these drives as identifiers for
WebBuy. Even if your system recognizes the drives, WebBuy will only recognize
the media for licensing if the Iomega drivers have been installed. [ 413448
]<BR><BR><B>Using Windows Internet Explorer</B><BR>If you install Acrobat 4.x
after Acrobat Reader 5.x, The Acrobat 4.x ActiveX Control will be used with the
browser. Because an Acrobat Reader 5.x registry setting exists, Internet
Explorer will always launch Acrobat 4 when it starts. To avoid this problem,
uninstall Acrobat Reader 5.x before installing Acrobat 4.x. [ 366101
]<BR><BR><B>Printing collated copies does not work on Windows 2000.</B><B> [
415358, 418016 ]<BR><BR>Using the right click command to print uses the
PostScript Language Level setting of the previous print job on Windows NT and
Windows 2000</B><BR>If you open a document in Acrobat and print it to a
PostScript Language Level 3 printer the language level used by Acrobat will be
set to PostScript Language Level 3 by default. If you exit Acrobat and change
the default printer to be a PostScript Level 2 printer and then right-click on a
PDF file to request printing, the print job will abort because the PostScript
Language Level is set to Level 3 not Level 2. To prevent this, after changing
the default printer, open and print a document in Acrobat before using the
right-click command to print. [ 416598, 418016 ]<BR><BR><B>Invalid Document
Rights</B><BR>If you open a PDF with Document Rights and get a message that
says: ... rights are invalid... contact the author...", it is likely that the
author of the PDF file changed the file after Document Rights were added to it.
The author will need to reapply Document Rights to the file before Acrobat
Reader 5.1 will be able to use the PDF as intended.. [ 500795
]<BR><BR><B>Acrobat 3.x and PDF files with Document Rights</B><BR>Acrobat 3.x
may show error messages when opening a PDF file that includes Document Rights. [
523105 ]<BR><BR><B>Zoom shortcut keys on Chinese&nbsp;Windows OS</B><BR>On
Chinese Windows OS, the shortcut keys Ctrl+Spacebar and Alt+Ctrl+Spacebar will
bring up IME and not Zoom in or out. [ 525402 ]<BR><BR><B>Deselecting Text on Korean&nbsp;Windows
OS<BR></B>Instead of deselecting text,
</B>Shift+Ctrl+A could incorrectly bring up another application such as ICQ on
your monitor. If this happens, click with your mouse on any selected
text area to deselect all highlighted text in the document. [ 525222
]<BR><BR><B>Error loading the Plug-In AcroFill.api</B><BR>If you get the error
message "There was an error loading the Plug-In AcroFill.api" when launching
Acrobat Reader, you may have an older version of MSVCRT.dll. Please upgrade to
the latest MSVCRT.dll or reinstall Windows using your installation CDs (in case
it was erroneously replaced by some other installer). [ 526383
]<BR><BR><B>Certified mode and PDF&nbsp;files with Document Rights
</B><BR>Acrobat Reader does NOT require the Certified Plug-ins Only option in
the Options panel of the Preferences dialog box to open PDF files with
additional usage rights. [ 529812
